# The Ultimate Gate

## Welcome, My Friend! 

Take A Look Around...

Another locked room, a sight you're all too familiar with. They call you the "Escape Master," simply because your escape skills are nothing short of extraordinary.

Each room is a brand-new puzzle, and you’ll untangle every thread, remove every obstacle, until you stand on a stage surrounded by applause.

But that’s not the end—not even close, and you know it. There’s a door, one not part of any planned level. It flickers in and out of view, appearing in every dream you have.

You’re getting closer to it. Every victory, every honor, is just another step toward that door.

You must open it, because... there’s no door in this world you can’t unlock.

Enjoy A Delightful Time Solving Puzzles together!

Look: What does this room look like? How many doors are there? Are the doors locked?

Listen: Click, clack... How much time is left? What did the host say? Where are the clues to escape?

Feel: How tall is that door, and how does it feel to the touch?
Let your senses break through the shackles to feel the puzzle itself.
The truth is always in plain sight, but if we rely solely on our eyes, we are like being in the eternal darkness, groping our way forward.

Pause: Slow down, even more.
Do not chase after the puzzle; in the world of riddles, there is no answer that comes from competition.

It asks alone, it answers alone; it is both the puzzle and the solution;

It is the door to truth, it is the key to truth.

Ah... that key has always been on the door, can't you see it?

Can you also glimpse the light of truth behind layers of mystery?
