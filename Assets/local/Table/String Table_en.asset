      Ah, the indescribable journey begins in the
      land of China, at the appointed hour. I board the iron bird that has flown
      from Jakarta (VECC), departing from Taipei (RCSS), filled with an uncontrollable
      shiver and excitement. The destination is the distant and mysterious Sydney
      (YSSY), with a brief stopover in Tokyo (RJTT). It all feels like the arrangement
      of fate, guided by an unknown force.

      04/30 15:45

      As we traversed
      the endless sea of clouds, the iron bird smoothly landed at our stopover, where
      the air seemed charged with hidden movements. After disembarking, my disoriented
      steps led me through the foreign transfer corridor. Shadows of people intertwined,
      a mix of noise and tranquility, as if a ritual of prayers was already in progress.
      Each step I took felt like treading on the brink of an impending abyss, my
      rising energy brimming with primal force.

      04/30 17:10

      Once again,
      I boarded the iron bird, and the indescribable feeling within me grew stronger.
      It felt as if an invisible presence was watching over me, guiding me to break
      free from the shackles of restraint. The cabin lights dimmed, and the faces
      of the passengers blurred like illusions. I understood deeply that this journey
      would be anything but ordinary; it would lead me closer to some truth that
      transcends reason, some meaning that humanity cannot fully comprehend. I pressed
      the button.

      CYVR.\r\nThe holy messenger said that light would soon descend upon Sydney.
      I must complete my mission during my layovers in London and S\xE3o Paulo.\r\n04/30\r\nI

      when we landed in EGLL, fog enveloped the land of London, as if some unknown

      me resembling a fast-forwarded film. Until I carefully tucked away that most
      innocent part of myself and brought it onto the plane.\r\n04/30\r\nThe fervent
      emotions in my heart grew stronger. I knew that every moment of this journey
      was filled with the arrangement of fate. When the plane landed at 05:45 in
      SBGR, every star in S\xE3o Paulo's night sky was winking at me. I gazed through
      blue irises and locked eyes with those legendary deities, praying for guidance
      in my every step. A girl with long hair approached me to ask for directions.\r\n05/01\r\nFinally,
      I have arrived in YSSY, in Sydney, a land full of unknowns. Time and space
      seemed to intertwine at this moment, making it impossible to distinguish reality
      from dreams. This journey is not merely a physical movement but a tempering
      of the soul. I am keenly aware that this is just the prologue; the true revelation
      is about to unfold.\r\n"

      Oslo (ENGM). The aviation security centers in both locations received reports

      on the flight claimed to have seen the woman standing motionless at the boarding
      bridge, her eyes hollow, as if her soul had been stripped away by an invisible
      force. The woman was heard continuously mumbling strange sounds, emanating
      an ominous aura. Airport security personnel intervened immediately, but the
      woman vanished in the chaos, seemingly evaporating into thin air.\r\nThe disappearance
      case is currently under investigation by relevant authorities, and further
      updates are awaited.\r\n"

      Paulo (SBGR). My flight had layovers in the Los Angeles (KLAX) and Cairo (HECA),
      but this journey felt as though it were destined to be shrouded in darkness.\r\nAt
      14:45, the plane landed in Los Angeles, and the airport was immediately filled
      with eerie, ominous signs. Reports indicated that local security personnel
      discovered an ancient scroll filled with indecipherable runes and strange patterns
      while checking passenger luggage. Soon after, several security staff collapsed,
      mumbling to themselves in what seemed to be an unknown language. I later heard
      that those individuals had been taken to the hospital but never regained consciousness;
      doctors were helpless, staring in horror at their contorted faces.\r\nSorry
      for digressing; let me continue...\r\nThe flight was not delayed and arrived
      on time at 22:30 in Cairo. As night fell, the air around the airport seemed
      to crystallize into some invisible barrier. I overheard local staff reporting
      on the radio that the lights in the airport flickered erratically, as if under
      the control of some mysterious force. Witnesses claimed to have seen a man
      in ancient robes appear in the airport, his eyes shimmering with an unusual
      light, his movements ghostly as he vanished into the shadows. Passengers felt
      uneasy, unable to explain the phenomena.\r\nFinally, at 01:19 on May 3rd, the
      plane arrived in S\xE3o Paulo. I thought this strange journey had come to an
      end. But while processing immigration and waiting for my luggage, all passengers
      from that flight were gathered for special reasons. I inquired with a chatty
      customs officer, who said that several passengers had mysteriously disappeared
      upon arrival, leaving behind only a few pieces of luggage and chaos.\r\nWhat
      followed became a sensational topic online. Police investigations revealed
      that these missing individuals had exhibited unusual behavior during the flight.
      As the investigation deepened, more and more chilling details emerged; while
      the backgrounds of the missing varied, their destination was strikingly uniform\u2014
      the Amazon jungle, yes, indeed, the mysterious area where a strange pink meteor
      had recently fallen.\r\n"

      Past the bright
      clusters of dimensioned space,

      Till neither time nor matter stretched
      before me,

      But only Chaos, without form or place.

      Here the vast
      Lord of All in darkness muttered

      Things he had dreamed but could not
      understand,

      While near him shapeless bat-things flopped and fluttered

      In
      idiot vortices that ray-streams fanned.

      They danced insanely to the
      high, thin whining

      Of a cracked flute clutched in a monstrous paw,

      Whence
      flow the aimless waves whose chance combining

      Gives each frail cosmos
      its eternal law.

      "I am His Messenger," the daemon said,

      As in
      contempt he struck his Master''s head."'
